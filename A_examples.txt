set of steps for computer program to accomplish a task
algorithms are what puts the science in computer science


Examples
- google hangouts audio vision compression algorithms
- google maps route finding algorithm
- pixar coloring by 3d lighting - rebndering algorithm
- how to change solar panels 0- optimisation and scheduling algorithm

these a re complex examples but are a set of steps

game - user vs computer - minimax search algorithm

what makes a good algorithm
- solves the problem
- efficiently

sometimes algorithms to find perfect result will take a very long time.
sometimes we need to have an algorithm which runs fast and gives a solid output which is not perfect. perfect does not always = best

linear search - goes through each iterations one at a time
binary search - halves the list - tests, halves the list, test, until you find answer
